SevenSenses
SevenSenses is a comprehensive yoga education platform designed to deliver a dynamic and interactive learning experience for users interested in yoga. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this platform facilitates seamless course management and user engagement.

Project Description
SevenSenses aims to provide:

An engaging learning experience with a variety of yoga courses.
A platform for instructors to share their expertise and interact with students.
A user-friendly interface for easy navigation and course management.
System Architecture
SevenSenses is structured into three main components: front-end, back-end, and database. The platform operates on a client-server architecture where the front-end interacts with users, and the back-end manages data processing and storage.

Front-end
The front-end is developed using React.js, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface. Key features include:

Homepage: Introduction to the platform with links to course lists and user profiles.
Course List: Displays available courses with descriptions and ratings.
Course Details: Includes course content and related materials.
User Management: Allows users to view and edit their profiles and manage their course enrollments.
Back-end
The back-end is built using Node.js and Express.js, offering robust support for:

User Authentication and Authorization: Secure login and registration, including OTP verification and password management.
Course Management: CRUD operations for courses, media management, and user interactions.
Payment Integration: Course purchases handled through Razorpay.
Database
MongoDB is used for flexible data storage, supporting:

Course Content: Videos, images, and PDFs.
User Data: Details for students and instructors.
